## Features

- **Simple Syntax**: Declare variables with `let` (strings) and `num` (numbers).
- **Formatted Printing**: Use `print(o"...")` with `{variable}` placeholders.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Supports arithmetic operations with keywords like `plus`, `minus`, etc.
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for undefined variables or invalid syntax.

## Current Status  

VortLang is in its early stages and currently supports basic features like variable declarations and arithmetic. More functionality is planned for future releases. Stay tuned!  

## Installation
