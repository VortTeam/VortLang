# This is the simplest VortLang program - it just prints a message to the screen
# Lines starting with # are comments and are ignored by the interpreter

# The print statement displays text to the console
# Text must be enclosed in double quotes
print("Hello, World!");

# Every statement in VortLang must end with a semicolon
# The semicolon tells the interpreter that the statement is complete
